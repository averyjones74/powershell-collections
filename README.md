# Josh's PowerShell collection

A collection of PowerShell Scripts, Tools, and Modules. Mostly related to some of my projects, my work, or just a blog post of me.

Most of the stuff here is also available as a [Gist](https://gist.github.com/jhochwald) or on my personal [blog](http://hochwald.net).

## Status

![CI](https://github.com/jhochwald/PowerShell-collection/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

### Legacy Notice

I no longer run Exchange, Skype for Business, or any other Office Server on Premises.
This is my personal [reaction](https://hochwald.net/microsoft-rolls-back-decision-to-take-away-internal-usage-rights-from-partners/) to the changes that Microsoft [announced](https://hochwald.net/microsoft-is-going-to-kill-internal-use-rights-benefit-for-partners/) for the Internal Use Rights (IUR) program. I know that they decided to reverse that changes and in theory, I could still legally use the software. However, I decided to decommission everything licensed under the terms of the Internal Use Rights (IUR) program.
In my opinion, the community always should have some benefits from the Internal Use Rights (IUR) program and/or Action Pack. Now that I decided to drop out, there will be no more such benefits.

I will _no longer maintain_ the scripts related to the Microsoft Office (on Premises) servers. They will remain here, but unmaintained. Fork the repository and maintain or extend them if you like to. The [License](https://github.com/jhochwald/PowerShell-collection/blob/master/LICENSE) allows that easily.

### Please note

Some, or better most, of the stuff here was a function. This is because I like functions more (my personal preference). I converted most to single files. You can convert them back if you like.

#### Why so detailed?

I was asked why all my scripts contain so many comments, and why they are so well formatted... I hope you do not just download them and let them run (What is dangerous anyway). They should show you how to build and create your own tooling! That is the main reason why I try to avoid the usage of aliases within my scripts and use splatting to make them more human readable.

#### Why in general?

Many ask me that question!
The answer is simple: "*I like to contribute back to the community!*"
The long answer: "*I still try to automate all the things! And I love to show what PowerShell can do... As a result, I started to publish a lot of code. Things I build, things I like, or just things I found interesting to build :-)*"

### Found a bug or Issue?

If you find something bad (like a bug, error, or any issue), please report it here by open an [Issue](https://github.com/jhochwald/PowerShell-collection/issues).

Or even better: Fork the Repository, fix it and submit a [pull request](https://github.com/jhochwald/PowerShell-collection/pulls), so others can participate too!

See the [Contribution Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details!

### Contribution

More then welcome! Please see the [Contribution Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details!

#### Any ideas?

I still search for a free code signing certificate for my open-source projects. So, does anyone know a source?

Even if there is no "free" version for my open-source projects, I would also pay for a valid certificate (again). However, most of the sources I found are not cheap! Does anyone know a cheap source for a signing certificate?

### Default License

In my opinion: All the stuff here should be free, and the license should be as flexible as possible.
